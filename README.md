## Instructions
## Calibration

The Simulation will automatically take a moment to load and calibrate.

## Main Menu

The Menu is divided into a few sections:

At the top is a Message Area which will update with the current Ship's Actions.

The Command Interface contains a number of Ship's Systems: Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, Shields, Alert, Engines, and Sensors. Their corresponding Status is to the right.

The Prompt at the bottom allows the User to interact with a Ship's System.

When selecting a System, the Command Interface and Message Area will update. The text alignment will adjust to make viewing the various System Statuses quick and easy.

Feel free to input the keywords or give orders with full sentences.
